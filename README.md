# Soul-Food-For-You
This is a example website of a restaurant menu that I created using Visual Studio Code
Here is the page to the website: https://cc267.github.io/Soul-Food-For-You/ (if you are using the website on a mobile device such as a smartphone or a tablet, you may need to set it horizontally so the website can look much better due to its large size)
